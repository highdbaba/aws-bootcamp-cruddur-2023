## Home work submission

### Install AWSCLI

I was able to install awscli using shared script as explained
When I opened Gitpod from Github, script automatically ran and awscli was installed. 

### Set MFA, IAM role
I created a new account, which means that root account is not in use for security reasons
I also setup an admin group with Admin permission. I also ensured that my user is a member of the admin group
I also setup up MFA using Duo authenticator.

SNS
